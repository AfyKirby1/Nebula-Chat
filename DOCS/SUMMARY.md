# Project Summary & Status

**Nebula Chat** is a production-ready, Next.js-based interface for Google's Gemini AI models. It serves as a reference implementation for building modern, streaming, and interactive AI applications.

## Current Status: 🟢 Active / Stable

The project has reached a significant milestone (v0.1.9) with the introduction of durable streaming architecture, holiday theming, and comprehensive documentation. It is fully functional, performant, and includes advanced capabilities typically found in enterprise SaaS tools.

### Key Milestones Achieved
- ✅ **Core Chat Loop**: Reliable streaming, error handling, and state management.
- ✅ **Model Integration**: Full support for Gemini 3 Pro, 2.5, and 2.0 series.
- ✅ **Artifact System**: Advanced code viewing with fusion engine and live preview.
- ✅ **Visual Intelligence**: Neural background and Mermaid diagram support.
- ✅ **Personalization**: User settings, persistent history, and core memories system.
- ✅ **Durable Streaming**: Redis-backed architecture for resilient message delivery.
- ✅ **Theme System**: Dark/light mode with Christmas theme overlay.
- ✅ **Persona System**: Specialized AI modes (Developer, Creative, Analyst, Standard).

## The "Why" (Value Proposition)

Why use Nebula Chat over the standard Google AI Studio or other interfaces?

1.  **Transparency**: See the "Thinking" process of the model (Gemini 3 Pro).
2.  **Control**: You own the API key, the history (local), and the configuration.
3.  **Visuals**: The Neural Canvas provides a unique, immersive aesthetic that reduces fatigue.
4.  **Workflow**: The Artifact Viewer allows for side-by-side coding and chatting, mimicking an IDE experience.
5.  **Multimodal**: Talk to your AI and show it images, just like a human collaborator.
6.  **Education**: It's a teaching tool for how to build streaming AI apps with Next.js.

## Next Steps (Short Term)
- [ ] **Vector Memory**: Implementing a local vector store for long-term context.
- [ ] **Mobile PWA**: Making the app installable on phones.

## Next Steps (Long Term)
- [ ] **Plugin Architecture**: Connecting to external tools (Search, Calculator).
- [ ] **Team Collaboration**: Shared chat sessions via WebSockets.
